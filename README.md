TODO:    
This iteration was spent outlining the framework for the rest of the project. We created student, event, and company classes. For this iteration we spent our efforts on the student class, creating tests for primarily getters and setters. There are some aspects such as "resume" objects that don't work yet. We also make the code functionable in our run.java file, which includes main() and right now allows the user to add new members and display a person's information. Functions related to events and companies have not been implemented yet.
